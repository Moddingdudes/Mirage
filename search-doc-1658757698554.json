[{"title":"Overview","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/components/","content":"Overview These core components are included in Mirage: Network Animator The Network Animator component allows you to synchronize animation states for networked objects. It synchronizes state and parameters from an Animator Controller. Network Authenticator Network Authenticators facilitate the integration of user accounts and credentials into your application. Network Discovery Network Discovery uses a UDP broadcast on the LAN enabling clients to find the running server and connect to it. Network Identity The Network Identity component is at the heart of the Mirage networking high-level API. It controls a game object’s unique identity on the network, and it uses that identity to make the networking system aware of the game object. It offers two different options for configuration and they are mutually exclusive, which means either one of the options or none can be checked. Network LogSettings Adds logging levels per class for Mirror components Network Manager The Network Manager is a component for managing the networking aspects of a multiplayer game. Network Manager HUD The Network Manager HUD is a quick-start tool to help you start building your multiplayer game straight away, without first having to build a user interface for game creation/connection/joining. It allows you to jump straight into your gameplay programming and means you can build your own version of these controls later in your development schedule. Network Match Checker The Network Match Checker component controls the visibility of networked objects based on match id. Network Ping DisplayNetwork Ping Display shows the Ping time for clients using OnGUI Network Proximity Checker The Network Proximity Checker component controls the visibility of game objects for network clients, based on proximity to players. Network RigidbodyThe Network Rigidbody synchronizes velocity and other properties of a rigidbody across the network. Network Room Manager The Network Room Manager is an extension component of Network Manager that provides a basic functional room. Network Room Player The Network Room Player is a component that's required on Player prefabs used in the Room Scene with the Network Room Manager above. Network Scene Checker The Network Scene Checker component controls the visibility of networked objects between scenes. Network Start Position Network Start Position is used by the Network Manager when creating character objects. The position and rotation of the Network Start Position are used to place the newly created character object. Network Transform The Network Transform component synchronizes the movement and rotation of game objects across the network. Note that the network Transform component only synchronizes spawned networked game objects. Network Transform Child The Network Transform Child component synchronizes the position and rotation of the child game object of a game object with a Network Transform component.","keywords":""},{"title":"Authentication","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/components/authenticators/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Encryption Notice​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Authentication","url":"docs/components/authenticators/#encryption-notice","content":"By default Mirage is not encrypted, so if you want to do authentication through Mirage, we highly recommend you use a transport that supports encryption.

However, because Q=-Q, if the largest element is negative we can just flip the sign of all 4 elements instead. Max of the second largest element​ The value of the 2nd largest element is when it is also equal to the largest so we have L^2 + L^2 = 1 From this, we can find the max value for the 2nd largest is L = +- 1 / sqrt(2) = +- ~0.707 This allows us to pack the smallest 3 elements in the range -0.707 to +0.707 instead of -1 to +1 Result​ Combining all this we can send each of the smallest 3 elements with 9 bits, and 2 bits for the index of the largest element.

Casting this down to a float means the clock will lose precision after some time: after 1 day, the accuracy goes down to 8 msafter 10 days, the accuracy is 62 msafter 30 days, the accuracy is 250 mafter 60 days, the accuracy is 500 ms Mirage will also calculate the Return Trip Time as seen by the application: double rtt = NetworkTime.Rtt; note Return RTT will also be affected by the frame rate. A higher frame rate will mean less delay before the server reads the ping message and replies. You can check the precision using: double timeStandardDeviation = NetworkTime.TimeSd; For example, if this returns 0.2, it means the time measurements swing up and down roughly 0.2 seconds. Network time is smoothing out the values using Exponential moving average. You can configure how often you want the client to send pings using: NetworkTime.PingInterval = 2.0f; You can configure how quickly results will change using: NetworkTime.PingWindowSize = 10; A higher number will result in smoother results, but a longer time to adjust to changes.","keywords":""},{"title":"Community Guides","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/community-guides/","content":"Community Guides This section contains guides written by the community rather than by the developers themselves Mirage Quick Start Guide by StephenAllenGames.co.uk tip If you want to submit a guide either create a pull request or ask in the Discord server.","keywords":""},{"title":"Mirage Quick Start Guide V0.1","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/community-guides/mirage-quick-start-guide","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Installation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Mirage Quick Start Guide V0.1","url":"docs/guides/community-guides/mirage-quick-start-guide#installation","content":"Before everything, to install Mirage we need to add a new package manager repository to our project.

So for this, we click on Window menu and then Package Manager. At this window, we will click on a small button that says (probably, at today date on Unity Editor 2021.13f) Packages: In Project, here we have to select My registries. Once, you've done that, we should be able to see Mirage and a few transport and also plugins in that list.

Since we are not changing scenes between server open or close, we could disable the NetworkSceneManager, but we can leave it as it is. UdpSocketFactory is the one that does the connection, so you can change the IP and port if necessary there. Now let's set up a few things on the scene, to make it look more like a game Add a simple Plane floor with: positions (0, -1, 0)scale (2, 2, 2) Next, we add a GameObject, name with the name StartPosition1 set position (1, 1, 1) We go back to our NetworkManager GO, over Character Spawner component we will change the Player Spawn Method from Random to Round Robin.

Create a capsule in the scene hierarchy and name it PlayerAttach a NetworkIdentity and NetworkTransform component into the capsule.Tick Client Authority on the NetworkTransform This is how our Player GO components should look right now  NOTE: Is not needed to set anything else here, Server Object Manager and Client Object Manager will be set dynamically by Mirage later. Next steps: Add a new Script, call it PlayerScriptThen drag this GO with the mouse into the assets folder (You should probably create a Prefabs folder later as a good practice) and release the mouse there. That will create a Prefab for us. (You can notice this was successful because your GO icon in the scene hierarchy will be blue now)Then delete Player from the scene At this stage, our player is done, so right now we need to tell Mirage who is our player in order to spawn it. So this is very easy, just go to your NetworkManager GO and open (if it is not) Character Spawner, then drag the player prefab we created before in the Player Prefab field.  The last step we will need to do is simple: go to the script we created before (you can go into the assets folder and it will be there) and double click it and it will open your IDE. So what we will need to do is simple: tell how we are moving the user, and also to set the camera as a child of the player. We can do that simply like this: using Mirage; using UnityEngine; namespace GettingStarted { public class PlayerScript : NetworkBehaviour { private void Awake() { Identity.OnStartLocalPlayer.AddListener(OnStartLocalPlayer); } private void OnStartLocalPlayer() { Camera.main.transform.SetParent(transform); Camera.main.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); } private void Update() { if (!IsLocalPlayer) { return; } float moveX = Input.GetAxis(&quot;Horizontal&quot;) * Time.deltaTime * 110.0f; float moveZ = Input.GetAxis(&quot;Vertical&quot;) * Time.deltaTime * 4f; transform.Rotate(0, moveX, 0); transform.Translate(0, 0, moveZ); } } }  Press play in Unity editor and... what happened?

As long as the game object already exists on both the server and the client, the reference should be fine. When the sync data arrives at the client, the referenced game object may not yet exist on that client, resulting in null values in the sync data. This is because internally Mirage passes the NetId from the NetworkIdentity and tries to look it up on the client's NetworkIdentity.World.Spawned dictionary. If the object hasn't been spawned on the client yet, no match will be found. It could be in the same payload, especially for joining clients, but after the sync data from another object. It could also be null because the game object is excluded from a client due to network visibility, e.g. NetworkProximityChecker. You may find that it's more robust to sync the NetworkIdentity.NetID (uint) instead, and do your own lookup inNetworkIdentity.World.Spawned to get the object, perhaps in a coroutine:  public GameObject target; [SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnTargetChanged))] public uint targetID; void OnTargetChanged(uint _, uint newValue) { if (NetworkIdentity.World.Spawned.TryGetValue(targetID, out NetworkIdentity identity)) target = identity.gameObject; else StartCoroutine(SetTarget()); } IEnumerator SetTarget() { while (target == null) { yield return null; if (NetworkIdentity.World.SpawnedObjects.TryGetValue(targetID, out NetworkIdentity identity)) target = identity.gameObject; } }  "},{"title":"Custom Data Types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Data Types","url":"docs/guides/data-types#custom-data-types","content":"Sometimes you don't want Mirage to generate serialization for your own types.

Sometimes you may want to serialize data that uses a different type not supported by Mirage, such as DateTime or System.Uri. You can add support for any type by adding extension methods to NetworkWriter and NetworkReader. For example, to add support for DateTime, add this somewhere in your project: public static class DateTimeReaderWriter { public static void WriteDateTime(this NetworkWriter writer, DateTime dateTime) { writer.WriteInt64(dateTime.Ticks); } public static DateTime ReadDateTime(this NetworkReader reader) { return new DateTime(reader.ReadInt64()); } }  ...then you can use DateTime in your [ServerRpc] or SyncList "},{"title":"Inheritance and Polymorphism​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Data Types","url":"docs/guides/data-types#inheritance-and-polymorphism","content":"Sometimes you might want to send a polymorphic data type to your commands.

For example, you may have a bunch of swords created as scriptable objects and you want to put the equipped sword in a SyncVar. This will work fine, Mirage will generate a reader and writer for scriptable objects by calling ScriptableObject.CreateInstance and copy all the data. However, the generated reader and writer are not suitable for every occasion. Scriptable objects often reference other assets such as textures, prefabs, or other types that can't be serialized. Scriptable objects are often saved in the Resources folder or they can sometimes have a large amount of data in them. The generated reader and writers may not work or may be inefficient for these situations. Instead of passing the scriptable object data, you can pass the name and the other side can look up the same object by name. This way you can have any kind of data in your scriptable object. You can do that by providing a custom reader and writer. Here is an example: [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = &quot;New Armor&quot;, menuName = &quot;Armor Data&quot;)] class Armor : ScriptableObject { public int Hitpoints; public int Weight; public string Description; public Texture2D Icon; // ... } public static class ArmorSerializer { public static void WriteArmor(this NetworkWriter writer, Armor armor) { // No need to serialize the data, just the name of the armor. writer.WriteString(armor.name); } public static Armor ReadArmor(this NetworkReader reader) { // Load the same armor by name.

You can place it on your computer run it and connect to it as a client.Dedicated Server: Same as the server build but placed on an external machine, you connect to it with the server's external IP. This guide will focus on the &quot;Dedicated Server&quot; option. There are multiple providers and even self-hosted dedicated machines. All possibilities still go through the same process to ensure connectivity to clients. A few requirements for a dedicated server: Port forwarding (Not strictly necessary but makes everything a lot easier without needing NAT punch-through)Firewall exceptionsComputer/machine that stays online and accessible whenever you need it.

"},{"title":"Networked Game Objects","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/","content":"Networked Game Objects Networked game objects are game objects which are controlled and synchronized by Mirage’s networking system. Using synchronized networked game objects, you can create a shared experience for all the players who are playing an instance of your game. They see and hear the same events and actions - even though that may be from their own unique viewpoints within your game. Multiplayer games in Mirage are typically built using Scenes that contain a mix of networked game objects and regular (non-networked) game objects. The networked game objects are those which move or change during gameplay in a way that needs to be synchronized across all users who are playing the game together. Non-networked game objects are those that either don't move or change at all during gameplay (for example, static obstacles like rocks or fences) or game objects which have movement or changes that don’t need to be synchronized across players (for example, a gently swaying tree or clouds passing by in the background of your game). A networked game object is one that has a Network Identity component attached. However, a Network Identity component alone is not enough for your game object to be functional and active in your multiplayer game. The Network Identity component is the starting point for synchronization, and it allows the Network Manager to synchronize the creation and destruction of the game object, but other than that, it does not specify which properties of your game object should be synchronized. What exactly should be synchronized on each networked game object depends on the type of game you are making, and what each game object’s purpose is. Some examples of what you might want to synchronize are: The position and rotation of moving game objects such as the players and non-player characters.The animation state of an animated game objectThe value of a variable, for example, how much time is left in the current round of a game, or how much energy a player has. As a convenience, the initial position, rotation, and scale of the object are automatically synchronized by the NetworkIdentity. Any other state you wish to synchronize across the network needs to go in a NetworkBehaviour inside your GameObject. When an object is created in the server, you must tell Mirage to create it in the clients and keep track of it.

However, networked game objects that you save as part of a Scene (and therefore already exist in the Scene when it is loaded) are handled differently. These game objects are loaded as part of the Scene on both the client and server and exist at runtime before any spawn messages are sent by the multiplayer system. When the Scene is loaded, all networked game objects in the Scene are disabled on both the client and the server. Then, when the Scene is fully loaded, the Network Manager automatically processes the Scene’s networked game objects, registering them all (and therefore causing them to be synchronized across clients), and enabling them, as if they were spawned at runtime. Networked game objects will not be enabled until a client has requested a character object. Saving networked game objects in your Scene (rather than dynamically spawning them after the scene has loaded) has some benefits: They are loaded with the level, so there will be no pause at runtime.They can have specific modifications that differ from prefabsOther game object instances in the Scene can reference them, which can avoid you having to use code to find the game objects and make references to them up at runtime. When the Network Manager spawns the networked Scene game objects, those game objects behave like dynamically spawned game objects. Mirage sends them updates and ClientRPC calls. If a Scene game object is destroyed on the server before a client joins the game, then it is never enabled on new clients that join. When a client connects, the client is sent an ObjectSpawnScene spawn message for each of the Scene game objects that exist on the server, that are visible to that client. This message causes the game object on the client to be enabled and has the latest state of that game object from the server in it. This means that only game objects that are visible to the client and not destroyed on the server, are activated on the client. Like regular non-Scene game objects, these Scene game objects are started with the latest state when the client joins the game.","keywords":""},{"title":"Pickups, Drops, and Child Objects","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/pickup-drop-child","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Child Objects​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Pickups, Drops, and Child Objects","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/pickup-drop-child#child-objects","content":"Let's start with the simple case of a single attachment point that is somewhere down the hierarchy of our Player, such as a hand at the end of an arm. In a script that inherits from NetworkBehaviour on the Player Prefab, we'd have a GameObject reference where the attachment point can be assigned in the inspector, a SyncVar enum with various choices of what the player is holding, and a Hook for the SyncVar to swap out the art of the held item based on the new value. In the image below, Kyle has an empty game object, RightHand, added to the wrist, and some prefabs to be equipped (Ball, Box, Cylinder), and a Player Equip script to handle them. The inspector shows RightHand assigned in 2 places, the Player Equip script, as well as the target of the Network Transform Child component, so we could adjust the relative position of the attachment point (not the art) for all clients as needed.  Below is the Player Equip script to handle the changing of the equipped item, and some notes for consideration: While we could just have all the art items attached at design time and just enable/disable them based on the enum, this doesn't scale well to a lot of items and if they have scripts on them for how they behave in the game, such as animations, special effects, etc. it could get ugly pretty fast, so this example locally instantiates and destroys instead as a design choice.The example makes no effort to deal with position offset between the item and the attach point, e.g. having the grip or handle of an item aligns with the hand.

To spawn game objects without using the Network Manager, you can handle the Prefab registration yourself via script. Use the ClientScene.RegisterPrefab method to register Prefabs to the Network Manager. using UnityEngine; using Mirage; public class MyNetworkManager : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject treePrefab; public ClientObjectManager; public NetworkClient; public NetworkServer; public ServerObjectManager; void Start() { ClientObjectManager = FindObjectOfType&lt;ClientObjectManager&gt;(); NetworkClient = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkClient&gt;(); NetworkServer = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkServer&gt;(); ServerObjectManager = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkServer&gt;(); } // Register prefab and connect to the server public void ClientConnect() { ClientObjectManager.spawnPrefabs.Add(treePrefab); NetworkClient.Connect(&quot;localhost&quot;); NetworkClient.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ConnectMessage&gt;(OnClientConnect); } void OnClientConnect(NetworkConnection conn, ConnectMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;Connected to server: &quot; + conn); } }  In this example, you create an empty game object to act as the Network Manager, then create and attach the MyNetworkManager script (above) to that game object. Create a prefab that has a Network Identity component attached to it, and drag that onto the treePrefab slot on the MyNetworkManager component in the Inspector. This ensures that when the server spawns the tree game object, it also creates the same kind of game object on the clients. Registering prefabs ensures that there is no stalling or loading time for creating the Asset. For the script to work, you also need to add code for the server. Add this to the MyNetworkManager script: public void ServerListen() { // start listening, and allow up to 4 connections NetworkServer.StartServer(); NetworkServer.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ConnectMessage&gt;(OnServerConnect); NetworkServer.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ReadyMessage&gt;(OnClientReady); } // When client is ready spawn a few trees void OnClientReady(NetworkConnection conn, ReadyMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;Client is ready to start: &quot; + conn); SpawnTrees(); } void SpawnTrees() { int x = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) { GameObject treeGo = Instantiate(treePrefab, new Vector3(x++, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity); ServerObjectManager.Spawn(treeGo); } } void OnServerConnect(NetworkConnection conn, ConnectMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;New client connected: &quot; + conn); }  The server does not need to register anything, as it knows what game object is being spawned (and the asset ID is sent in the spawn message). The client needs to be able to look up the game object, so it must be registered on the client. When writing your own network manager, it’s important to make the client ready to receive state updates before calling the spawn command on the server, otherwise, they won’t be sent. If you’re using Mirage’s built-in Network Manager component, this happens automatically. For more advanced uses, such as object pools or dynamically created Assets, you can use the ClientObjectManager.RegisterSpawnHandler method, which allows callback functions to be registered for client-side spawning. See the documentation on Custom Spawn Functions for an example of this. If the game object has a network state like synchronized variables, then that state is synchronized with the spawn message. In the following example, this script is attached to the tree Prefab: using UnityEngine; using Mirage; public class Tree : NetworkBehaviour { [SyncVar] public int numLeaves; void Start() { Identity.OnStartClient.AddLisenter(OnStartClient); } public override void OnStartClient() { Debug.Log(&quot;Tree spawned with leaf count &quot; + numLeaves); } }  With this script attached, you can change the numLeaves variable and modify the SpawnTrees function to see it accurately reflected on the client: void SpawnTrees() { int x = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) { GameObject treeGo = Instantiate(treePrefab, new Vector3(x++, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity); Tree tree = treeGo.GetComponent&lt;Tree&gt;(); tree.numLeaves = Random.Range(10,200); Debug.Log(&quot;Spawning leaf with leaf count &quot; + tree.numLeaves); ServerObjectManager.Spawn(treeGo); } }  Attach the Tree script to the treePrefab script created earlier to see this in action.

That client can issue Server RPCs for that game object. On other clients (and on the host), HasAuthority is false. For example, the tree spawn example above can be modified to allow the tree to have client authority like this (note that we now need to pass in a Network Player game object for the owning client’s connection): void SpawnTrees(INetworkPlayer player) { int x = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) { GameObject treeGo = Instantiate(treePrefab, new Vector3(x++, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity); Tree tree = treeGo.GetComponent&lt;Tree&gt;(); tree.numLeaves = Random.Range(10,200); Debug.Log(&quot;Spawning leaf with leaf count &quot; + tree.numLeaves); ServerObjectManager.Spawn(treeGo, player); } }  The Tree script can now be modified to send a Server RPC Call to the server:  public void ClientConnect() { ClientObjectManager.spawnPrefabs.Add(treePrefab); NetworkClient.Connect(&quot;localhost&quot;); NetworkClient.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ConnectMessage&gt;(OnClientConnect); NetworkClient.Player.Identity.OnAuthorityChanged.AddListener(OnStartAuthority); } public override void OnStartAuthority(bool changed) { CmdMessageFromTree(&quot;Tree with &quot; + numLeaves + &quot; reporting in&quot;); } [ServerRpc] void CmdMessageFromTree(string msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;Client sent a tree message: &quot; + msg); }  Note that you can’t just add the CmdMessageFromTree call into OnStartClient, because at that point the authority has not been set yet, so the call would fail. "},{"title":"Player Game Objects","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/spawn-player","content":"Player Game Objects Mirage’s multiplayer HLAPI system handles player game objects differently than non-player game objects. When a new player joins the game (when a new client connects to the server), that player’s game object becomes a &quot;local player&quot; game object on the client of that player, and Unity associates the player’s connection with the player’s game object. Unity associates one player game object for each person playing the game, and routes networking Server RPC Calls to that individual game object. A player cannot invoke a Server RPC Call on another player’s game object, only their own. The NetworkBehaviour class (which you derive from to create your network scripts) has a property called IsLocalPlayer. On each client’s player game object, Mirage sets that property to true on the NetworkBehaviour script and invokes the OnStartLocalPlayer callback on the object's NetworkIdentity. This means each client has a different game object set up like this because on each client a different game object is the one that represents the local player. The diagram below shows two clients and their local players. Only the player game object that is &quot;yours&quot; (from your point of view as the player) has the IsLocalPlayer flag set. Usually, you should set this flag in the script to determine whether to process input, whether to make the camera track the game object or do any other client-side things that should only occur for the player belonging to that client. Player game objects represent the player (that is, the person playing the game) on the server, and run Server RPC Calls from the player’s client. These Server RPC Calls are secure client-to-server remote procedure calls. In this server-authoritative system, other non-player server-side game objects cannot receive Server RPC Calls directly from client-side game objects. This is both for security, and to reduce the complexity of building your game. By routing all incoming Server RPC Calls from users through the player game object, you can ensure that these messages come from the right place, the right client, and can be handled in a central location. The CharacterSpawner component adds a player every time a client connects to the server. In some situations though, you might want it not to add players until an input event happens - such as a user pressing a “start” button on the controller. To disable automatic player creation, you may want to write your own CharacterSpawner component and wait for the AddPlayerMessage message to be sent from the client.","keywords":""},{"title":"Custom Spawn Functions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/spawn-object-custom","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Setting Up a Game Object Pool with Custom Spawn Handlers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Custom Spawn Functions","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/spawn-object-custom#setting-up-a-game-object-pool-with-custom-spawn-handlers","content":"Here is an example of how you might set up a simple game object pooling system with custom spawn handlers.

Note that this applies to networked game objects in your scene, but does not affect the loading of Assets. Unity still takes time to load the Assets for registered Prefabs and Scene game objects. When a player moves within the world, the set of network-visible game objects changes. The player’s client is told about these changes as they happen. The ObjectHide message is sent to clients when a game object becomes no longer network-visible. By default, Mirage destroys the game object when it receives this message. When a game object becomes visible, the client receives an ObjectSpawn message, as if Mirage has spawned the game object for the first time.

This method is invoked on all scripts that inherit from NetworkVisibility on game objects that change the visibility state on the host. The default implementation of OnSetLocalVisibility disables or enables all renderer components on the game object. If you want to customize this implementation, you can override the method in your script, and provide new behavior for how the host (and therefore the local client) should respond when a game object becomes network-visible or invisible (such as disabling HUD elements or renderers). "},{"title":"Customizing Network Visibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Visibility","url":"docs/guides/network-visibility#customizing-network-visibility","content":"Sometimes you might want to use other kinds of visibility checks, such as grid-based rules, line-of-sight tests, navigation path tests, or any other type of test that suits your game. It may be helpful to understand how the Network Proximity Checker works. The Network Proximity Checker is implemented using the public visibility interface of Mirage’s HLAPI. Using this same interface, you can implement any kind of visibility rules you desire. Each NetworkIdentity keeps track of the set of players that it is visible to. The players that a NetworkIdentity game object is visible to are called the “observers” of the NetworkIdentity. The Network Proximity Checker calls the RebuildObservers method on the Network Identity component at a fixed interval (set using the “Vis Update Interval” value in the inspector), so that the set of network-visible game objects for each player is updated as they move around. In the NetworkVisibility class (which your custom observer scripts inherit from), there are some virtual functions for determining visibility. These are: OnCheckObserver This method is called on the server, on each networked game object when a new player enters the game. If it returns true, that player is added to the object’s observers. The Network Proximity Checker does a simple distance check in its implementation of this function and uses Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc to find the players that are within the visibility distance for this object.OnRebuildObservers This method is called on the server when RebuildObservers is invoked. This method expects the set of observers to be populated with the players that can see the object. The NetworkServer then handles sending ObjectHide and ObjectSpawn messages based on the differences between the old and new visibility sets.OnSetHostVisibility This method is called on the server by the visibility system for objects on a host. Objects on a host (with a local client) cannot be disabled or destroyed when they are not visible to the local client. So this function is called to allow custom code to hide these objects. A typical implementation will disable renderer components on the object. This is only called on local clients on a host. You can check whether any given networked game object is a player by checking if its NetworkIdentity has a valid Owner. For example: int hitCount = Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc(transform.position, visRange, hitsBuffer3D, castLayers); for (int i = 0; i &lt; hitCount; i++) { Collider hit = hitsBuffer3D[i]; NetworkIdentity identity = hit.GetComponent&lt;NetworkIdentity&gt;(); if (identity != null &amp;&amp; identity.Owner != null) observers.Add(identity.Owner); }  "},{"title":"Networking Concepts Overview","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/overview","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"High-level scripting API​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Networking Concepts Overview","url":"docs/guides/overview#high-level-scripting-api","content":"Mirage’s networking has a &quot;high-level&quot; scripting API (which we’ll refer to as the HLAPI).

It is a good idea to call them ReadMyType and WriteMyType so it is obvious what type they are for. However the name of the function doesn't matter, weaver should be able to find it no matter what it is called. Properties Example​ Weaver won't write properties, but a custom writer can be used to send them over the network. This can be useful if you want to have private set for your properties public struct MyData { public int someValue { get; private set; } public float anotherValue { get; private set; } public MyData(int someValue, float anotherValue) { this.someValue = someValue; this.anotherValue = anotherValue; } } public static class CustomReadWriteFunctions { public static void WriteMyType(this NetworkWriter writer, MyData value) { writer.WriteInt32(value.someValue); writer.WriteSingle(value.anotherValue); } public static MyData ReadMyType(this NetworkReader reader) { return new MyData(reader.ReadInt32(), reader.ReadSingle()); } }  Unsupported type Example​ Rigidbody is an unsupported type because it inherits from Component.

In the inspector change the &quot;Network Sync Mode&quot; from &quot;Observers&quot; (default) to &quot;Owner&quot; to let Mirage know to synchronize the data only with the owning client. For example, suppose you are making an inventory system. Suppose players A, B, and C are in the same area. There will be a total of 12 objects in the entire network: Client A has Player A (himself), Player B, and Player CClient B has Player A, Player B (himself), and Player CClient C has Player A, Player B, and Player C (himself)The server has Player A, Player B, Player C each one of them would have an Inventory component Suppose Player A picks up some loot. The server adds the loot to Player's A inventory, which would have a SyncLists of Items. By default, Mirage now has to synchronize player A's inventory everywhere, which means sending an update message to client A, client B, and client C, because they all have a copy of Player A. This is wasteful, Client B and Client C do not need to know about Player's A inventory, they never see it on screen. It is also a security problem, someone could hack the client and display other people's inventory and use it to their advantage. If you set the &quot;Network Sync Mode&quot; in the Inventory component to &quot;Owner&quot;, then Player A's inventory will only be synchronized with Client A. Now, suppose instead of 3 people you have 50 people in an area and one of them picks up loot. It means that instead of sending 50 messages to 50 different clients, you would only send 1.

The first time a game object is sent to a client, it must include a full state snapshot, but subsequent updates can save on bandwidth by including only incremental changes. The OnSerialize function should return true to indicate that an update should be sent. If it returns true, the dirty bits for that script are set to zero. If it returns false, the dirty bits are not changed. This allows multiple changes to a script to be accumulated over time and sent when the system is ready, instead of every frame. The OnSerialize function is only called for initialState or when the NetworkBehaviour is dirty. A NetworkBehaviour will only be dirty if a SyncVar or SyncObject (e.g. SyncList) has changed since the last OnSerialize call. After data has been sent the NetworkBehaviour will not be dirty again until the next syncInterval (set in the inspector). A NetworkBehaviour can also be marked as dirty by manually calling SetDirtyBit (this does not bypass the syncInterval limit).

This mask is available inside OnSerialize as syncVarDirtyBitsEach SyncVar in a NetworkBehaviour script is assigned a bit in the dirty mask.Changing the value of SyncVars causes the bit for that SyncVar to be set in the dirty maskAlternatively, calling SetDirtyBit writes directly to the dirty maskNetworkIdentity game objects are checked on the server as part of its update loopIf any NetworkBehaviours on a NetworkIdentity are dirty, then a UpdateVars packet is created for that game objectThe UpdateVars packet is populated by calling OnSerialize on each NetworkBehaviour on the game objectNetworkBehaviours that are not dirty write a zero to the packet for their dirty bitsNetworkBehaviours that are dirty write their dirty mask, then the values for the SyncVars that have changedIf OnSerialize returns true for a NetworkBehaviour, the dirty mask is reset for that NetworkBehaviour so it does not send again until its value changes.The UpdateVars packet is sent to ready clients that are observing the game object On the client: an UpdateVars packet is received for a game objectThe OnDeserialize function is called for each NetworkBehaviour script on the game objectEach NetworkBehaviour script on the game object reads a dirty mask.If the dirty mask for a NetworkBehaviour is zero, the OnDeserialize function returns without reading any moreIf the dirty mask is a non-zero value, then the OnDeserialize function reads the values for the SyncVars that correspond to the dirty bits that are setIf there are SyncVar hook functions, those are invoked with the value read from the stream.

When a NetworkIdentity object is spawned on a server with NetworkServer.SpawnObject(), and the prefab that the object was created from was registered with RegisterPrefab(), the client will use that prefab to instantiate a corresponding client object with the same netId. The ClientObjectManager has a list of spawnable prefabs, it uses this function to register those prefabs with the ClientScene. The set of current spawnable object is available in the ClientScene static member variable ClientScene.prefabs, which is a dictionary of PrefabHash and prefab references. Declaration​ public void RegisterPrefab(NetworkIdentity identity, SpawnHandlerDelegate spawnHandler, UnSpawnDelegate unspawnHandler)  Parameters​ Type\tName\tDescriptionMirage.NetworkIdentity\tidentity\tA Prefab that will be spawned. Mirage.SpawnHandlerDelegate\tspawnHandler\tA method to use as a custom spawnhandler on clients. Mirage.UnSpawnDelegate\tunspawnHandler\tA method to use as a custom un-spawnhandler on clients. UnregisterPrefab(NetworkIdentity)​ Removes a registered spawn prefab that was setup with ClientScene.RegisterPrefab. Declaration​ public void UnregisterPrefab(NetworkIdentity identity)  Parameters​ Type\tName\tDescriptionMirage.NetworkIdentity\tidentity\tThe prefab to be removed from registration. RegisterSpawnHandler(Int32, SpawnHandlerDelegate, UnSpawnDelegate)​ This is an advanced spawning function that registers a custom prefabHash with the UNET spawning system. This can be used to register custom spawning methods for an prefabHash - instead of the usual method of registering spawning methods for a prefab. This should be used when no prefab exists for the spawned objects - such as when they are constructed dynamically at runtime from configuration data. Declaration​ public void RegisterSpawnHandler(int prefabHash, SpawnHandlerDelegate spawnHandler, UnSpawnDelegate unspawnHandler)  Parameters​ Type\tName\tDescriptionSystem.Int32\tprefabHash Mirage.SpawnHandlerDelegate\tspawnHandler\tA method to use as a custom spawnhandler on clients. Mirage.UnSpawnDelegate\tunspawnHandler\tA method to use as a custom un-spawnhandler on clients. UnregisterSpawnHandler(Int32)​ Removes a registered spawn handler function that was registered with ClientScene.RegisterHandler(). Declaration​ public void UnregisterSpawnHandler(int prefabHash)  Parameters​ Type\tName\tDescriptionSystem.Int32\tprefabHash\tThe prefabHash for the handler to be removed for. ClearSpawners()​ This clears the registered spawn prefabs and spawn handler functions for this client. Declaration​ public void ClearSpawners()  DestroyAllClientObjects()​ Destroys all networked objects on the client. This can be used to clean up when a network connection is closed.
